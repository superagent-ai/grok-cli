- Plan Mode (read-only strategic analysis)
- Act Mode (read-write execution, requires approval)
- User-controlled mode transitions
- Separate models for planning vs execution

**Enterprise Value:** Risk mitigation, cost optimization, better outcomes, explicit approval gates

---

### 3. **Continue: Open Plugin Architecture**
**What We're Adopting:**
- Plugin SDK for unlimited extensibility

- Enterprise governance (RBAC, policies, audit logs)
- Multi-step autonomous task execution

**Enterprise Value:** Complete project understanding, compliance built-in, security/access control

---

### 5. **Goose (Block): Local-First Extensible Framework**
**What We're Adopting:**
- Local execution (runs entirely on-premise)
- Privacy-first architecture
- MCP-native interoperability
- Multi-modal UI (desktop + CLI)
- Air-gap mode support

**Enterprise Value:** Data sovereignty, privacy compliance, reduced cloud costs, industry flexibility

HYBRID      → Smart routing based on sensitivity
AIR_GAP     → Fully offline with pre-downloaded models
```

**Benefit:** Privacy, data sovereignty, cost control

---

### 🧠 Workspace Intelligence
- Semantic code search (find by intent, not text)
- Dependency graphs and impact analysis
- Smart context window (auto-select relevant files)
- Framework detection and monorepo support

**Benefit:** Better understanding = better results

---

### 🤖 Multi-Agent Orchestration
